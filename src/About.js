                At Windmill Brew, we believe that life is too short for boring tea. That's why we've set out on a mission to bring a little bit of South Africa to your cup with our premium Rooibos tea. Handpicked from the Western Cape, our tea is packed with the unique, earthy flavor that Rooibos is known for, and just a hint of natural sweetness. Sit back, relax, and enjoy a steaming hot cup of Windmill Brew Rooibos. Proost!
