# Online shop 

This serves as a skeleton of an online shop based on React. Features include 

- UI kits to customize buttons and forms by CSS. They can be adjusted based on the request.
- State management for cart functionality for web efficiency. Current functions: show the total purchase items & add or remove items.
- Page rendering management: Users can access relevant information with specific URLs.
- The demo is set as a tea shop. Firebase is used to create APIs. Seller can easily adjust product information. Stripe API is used for payment. 

AXE test is used to improve web accessibility. Git branches for major features (cart & detailed tabs content and rending) can be tracked for functionality adjustments.

Further optimization needs to be done: mobile responsiveness
